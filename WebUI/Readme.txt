WebUI HomeWork

Should make 2 scenarios on the following site: https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/

The first scenario was to Login/Navigate to Pay Grades page/Add a new record/Check its existing
The second scenario was to Login/Navigate to Pay Grades page/Add a new record but cancel the action/Check its not existing

As an addition task and help to run the testcases had to make a hook to delete the created record after every scenario.

Used Specflow, Selenium, NUnit, FluertAssertion, etc. packages.

Used Xpath and Css selectors to find the elements, made the steps in BDD format.

A LivingDoc test report and a Postman collection are attached as well.
